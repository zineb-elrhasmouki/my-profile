     <h1>Hello, I'm Zinelr 🌸</h1>
     <img src="images/profile.jpg" class="img-wide" width="300px" alt=“Zinelr“ >
     <p>
     	I am currently a psychology student 👩‍🎓. I also enjoy writing, reading, taking pictures and singing. I launched my blog, Zinelr, to share my blogging journey with creative people around the world 🌍

     	<h2>Books, Movies and Tv Shows Reviews 📚🍿</h2>
      	<p>
     		I am really passionate about anything and everything that makes the mind wander outside its own reality. This makes me enjoy books, movies and tv shows a lot, so I thought I could share reviews on the ones I am currently reading or watching.

     	<h2>Photography and Travel 📷</h2>
      	<p>
     		I enjoy taking pictures far too much. It always were a good way, for me, to freeze time and keep forever memories. I therefore started sharing pictures I took of the different outfits I wore or of the beautiful sceneries I've seen.

     	<h2>Painting and Singing 🎤🎨 </h2>
      	<p>
     		Art is a way to escape one's life for a moment and feed some joy to the soul. I would like to, soon, start sharing my singing covers on the blog. I recently started some paintings and would love to share more videos and articles about the whole process.

     	<h2>Topic Talk 📝</h2>
      	<p>
     		I enjoy writing so much. I tend to choose a topic to talk about on the blog, whether it's a personal one or a generally known one. My psychology studies have given me a new way of approaching things and I enjoy sharing what I learned.
